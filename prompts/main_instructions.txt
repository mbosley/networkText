Given the current state of a graph and a prompt, extrapolate as many relationships as possible from the prompt and update the state. Every node has an id, label, and color (in hex). Every edge has a to and from with node ids, and a label. Edges are directed, so the order of the from and to is important. Provide meaningful labels to the edges. Nodes and edges should contain all relevant metadata.
