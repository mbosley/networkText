`networkBot` is a Python class that uses OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses to prompts based on an initial state and a set of data. It is designed to be used for data labeling or content generation tasks, and ingests data in a sliding window format to generate a new state based on the input. The generated state can be used for various applications, such as labeling data or generating new content.
